# GraphQuery Roadmap

In order to move the GraphQuery ecosystem forward, we realize that it is essential to build a community, so we can move uniformly.

There are few key points that need to happen in the short/mid term, divided into two main sections:

- [Community](#community)
- [Other Language Native Support](#otherlang)
- [GraphQuery v2.0](#GraphQuery2)

_ðŸ‘‹ If you have more ideas on how to move the GraphQuery ecosystem forward, don't hesistate to [open a PR](https://github.com/storyicon/graphquery/edit/master/ROADMAP.md)_

## Community

The goal is to improve adoption and sustainability of the project.

- ðŸ’Ž Build a home page
- ðŸ“˜ Vastly improve documentation

## Other Language Native Support

GraphQuery running on languages â€‹â€‹other than golang will need to rely on service communication, which does cause some efficiency problems.      

âœ¨ Better communication solutions     
ðŸ”€ Native support for more languages

## GraphQuery v2.0

The goal is to summarize the different improvements that GraphQuery will need to accomplish for version 2.

- ðŸš€ Filter support
- ðŸ”¸ More built-in pipeline functions
- ðŸ“„ More data type support, like float and int
- ðŸ“— More intuitive grammar
